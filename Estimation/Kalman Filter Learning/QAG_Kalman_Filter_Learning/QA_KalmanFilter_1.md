**QA suggestions:**

1. convert the .ipynb file to a .py file as well

2. constants such as m_a, m_b, v_U should be capitalised

3. Include a plot of error in prediction to showcase the working of the algorithms

4. the suffix _m is for measured quantities so I think a different name should be given when you are using variables to define the standard deviation of the measurement, like in SIGMA_POS_M, SIGMA_VEL_M, SIGMA_W_BIB_M
