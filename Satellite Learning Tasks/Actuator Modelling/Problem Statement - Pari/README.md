In this problem statement, the input is the torque required, from which magnetic moment is calculated. Only one magnetorquer is simulated with duty cycle = 0.6. We use the constant time-step sampling method and compare analytical (propagated using Euler's equations) and calculated values. The magnetic field is assumed to be constant in the body frame and the moment of inertia matrix is set to identity. We take the number of turns in the magnetometer to be 450 and the area to be 49 sq.cm.
